# React Redux Address Book

## Introduction

You are creating the Address Book app, which enables Users to search for Contact Details of their friends, family, etc. The app is 99% ready, but there are some bugs and pieces of code missing. Fix them!

## Problem Statement

1. In order to complete the task, debug or write additional code to ensure all the unit tests pass. 

2. Be aware that there isn't a real back-end behind the app. The app is communicating with an asynchronous fake HTTP API implemented in `src/httpApi/fakeHttpApi.js`.

3. Mock data is used. There are 1000 fake contacts defined in . In `src/httpApi/contacts.json`.

4. Below there are the app requirements that apply when searching for and selecting contacts. Guiding hints on how you need to develop your code can be found in the `TODOs` comments in the app production code.
